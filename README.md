# What is RaSCSI?
RaSCSI is a virtual SCSI device emulator that runs on a Raspberry Pi. It can emulate several SCSI devices at one time. There is a control interface to attach / detach drives during runtime, as well as insert and eject removable media. This project is aimed at users of vintage Macintosh computers from the 1980's and 1990's.
